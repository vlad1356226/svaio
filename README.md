## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the utilities in your SvelteKit project. Each utility is designed to integrate smoothly into your workflow. Refer to the specific sections below for detailed usage instructions for each utility.

## Utilities Overview

### i18n

Internationalization (i18n) support allows you to easily manage multiple languages in your application. With SVAIO, you can set up language files and switch between languages seamlessly.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { i18n } from 'svaio/i18n';

i18n.setLocale('en'); // Set the current locale
console.log(i18n.translate('welcome')); // Output: "Welcome"
```

### Manifest

The manifest utility helps you create a web app manifest file. This file is essential for progressive web apps (PWAs) and provides metadata about your application.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { createManifest } from 'svaio/manifest';

const manifest = createManifest({
  name: 'My App',
  short_name: 'App',
  start_url: '/',
  display: 'standalone',
  background_color: '#ffffff',
  theme_color: '#000000',
});
```

### PigeonPosse

PigeonPosse is a utility for managing and displaying notifications in your application. It provides a simple API to create, update, and remove notifications.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { notify } from 'svaio/pigeonposse';

notify('This is a notification!', { type: 'info' });
```

### PWA

The PWA utility streamlines the process of turning your SvelteKit app into a progressive web app. It handles service worker registration and caching strategies.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { registerServiceWorker } from 'svaio/pwa';

registerServiceWorker('/sw.js');
```

### Robots

Manage your robots.txt file easily with the robots utility. This file instructs web crawlers on how to interact with your site.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { createRobots } from 'svaio/robots';

const robots = createRobots({
  UserAgent: '*',
  Disallow: '/private/',
});
```

### Sitemap

Generate a sitemap.xml file for your application with the sitemap utility. This helps search engines index your site effectively.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { generateSitemap } from 'svaio/sitemap';

const sitemap = generateSitemap([
  { url: '/', changefreq: 'daily', priority: 1.0 },
  { url: '/about', changefreq: 'monthly', priority: 0.8 },
]);
```

### UnoCSS

UnoCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you write styles directly in your HTML. SVAIO integrates UnoCSS for rapid styling.

#### Example Usage

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Hello, World!</div>
```

### Vite

SVAIO is built on top of Vite, a fast build tool that provides a smooth development experience. Use Vite's features to enhance your workflow.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [/* your plugins here */],
});
```
